<h2><b><i>About Morgan</i></b></h2>
Hello, my name is Morgan, though I go by Spekter online. I'm currently a student at Temple College, and I dabble in Youtube content creation primarily centered around video games on my channel, but I also have some experience with computer hardware and software troubleshooting, as well as graphic design and video editing.<br><br><br>
